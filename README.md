# WashU-Capstone-2023

This capstone project presents a thorough cybersecurity framework for an imaginary healthcare company. This project was completed with valuable guidance from Mr. Britt, Chief Information Officer of Magellan Health, and Mr. Sullivan, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer of Magellan Health.
Me and 4 other team members, play as a consultant company, with expertise in IT and cybersecurity, that aims to address the significant cybersecurity risks in the healthcare industry. This includes data breaches, ransomware, phishing, and DDoS attacks. 

After reviewing various IT security regulations (e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and Center for Internet Security (CIS)), we came up with a security framework that can cater to mid-sized healthcare companies. The framework stresses the importance of cybersecurity in protecting patient data, ensuring medical device security, maintaining operational continuity, managing financial implications, and complying with regulatory standards. 

Our key components of the framework include:
1.	Strategic Aspect: Focuses on business continuity, data lifecycle, compliance, and human training.
2.	Managerial Aspect: Deals with asset management, risk management, and third-party relationships.
3.	Technical Aspect: Covers cryptography/key management, security controls, physical and environmental security, access controls, and monitoring logging.
   
Our framework emphasizes the need for business continuity management, data lifecycle management, compliance with cybersecurity laws and regulations, and thorough human training. It also outlines detailed implementation strategies for each component, including asset management, risk management, cryptography, and key management, among others.
Additionally, we present a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed framework, highlighting the substantial initial and recurring costs against the significant benefits, including mitigated losses, compliance savings, asset protection, and overall risk reduction. The framework is expected to yield a positive return on investment, enhancing Y-GWASH Inc.'s overall cybersecurity posture and reducing its vulnerability to cyber threats. By implementing this framework, Y-GWASH Inc. is better able to protect its critical medical data and devices while also meeting increasingly stringent compliance requirements.

As technology evolves and cyber threats continue to evolve, Y-GWASH Inc. Cybersecurity policies need to be continuously monitored and updated. By implementing our proposed cybersecurity framework, Y-GWASH Inc. will be able to effectively protect its critical assets while preparing for security challenges that may arise in the future. This is not only an investment in technology, but also in the long-term success and sustainability of the company.
